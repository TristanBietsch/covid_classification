Overview
This project is slightly different than most on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements that describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to fulfill all of these requirements correctly, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
You are a researcher in a hospital lab and are given the task to develop a learning model that supports doctors with diagnosing illnesses that affect patients’ lungs. At your disposal, you have a set X-ray lung scans with examples of patients who had either pneumonia, Covid-19, or no illness. Using the Keras module, you will create a classification model that outputs a diagnosis based on a patient’s X-ray scan. You hope this model can help doctors with the challenge of deciphering X-ray scans and open a dialogue between your research team and the medical staff to create learning models that are as effective and interpretable as possible.
